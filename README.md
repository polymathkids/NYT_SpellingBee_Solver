# New York Times Spelling Bee Solver

Provides an interface for entering the 6 game letters and the middle key letter from the NYT Spelling Bee game. The code runs through the dictionary and finds words with at least 4 letters that contain words comprised of the game letters and the key letter. Letters can be used more than once but all words must contain the key letter at least once. Not all found words will be accepted by the game but there will be enough to earn the points needed for "genius" level.
